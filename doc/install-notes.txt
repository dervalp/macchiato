SPEAK Preview Installation Notes
================================

Overview
--------
Use thse notes to install preview versions of SPEAK.

As a prerequisite for installing SPEAK you will require Sitecore v7.2 installed.


Instructions
------------
1. Login to the Sitecore.Services build server, you can currently use a guest account:

   http://10.144.100.10:9111/overview.html

2. Open the 'Sitecore Services Integration - Deploy and Test' project and download the three Artifacts from the '05 - Smoke Test'.

   This will give you a Speak.Demo.Site.zip archive and two Sitecore update packages.

3. Load the /sitecore/admin/UpdateInstallationWizard.aspx page for site.

4. Install the Speak.0.1.x.x.update package

5. Install the Speak.Demo.Content.0.1.x.x.update package

6. Extract the contents of the Speak.Demo.Site.zip into the folder containing your Sitecore v7.1 instance.

7. Rename the App_Config\Include\DataFolder.config.example file to App_Config\Include\DataFolder.config

   Edit the contents of the App_Config\Include\DataFolder.config file. Change the 'C:\Websites\speak\Data' 
   value to reflect the location of your Sitecore v7.1 instance data folder.

   Note: this step only needs to be performed the first time that you install the SPEAK preview version.

8. Publish the site content.


You should now be able to view the demo site content. For example:

- Javascript automation of call to Post Controller on the server

  /test/datatest


- Vanilla Web Api Products controller

  Demonstrates that the SPEAK implemetation does not have side effects on any existing Web Api controllers 
  within the site.

  /api/products
  /api/products/2


- EntityService<SimpleData> controller example
